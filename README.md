These programs are clients for the FM controller networking built into the
MMDVM Host.

The Parrot is very simple minded and can only handle one client at a time and
is therefore not suitable for use as a shared resource via the Internet.

The MMDVM .ini file should have the IP address and port number of the
client in the [FM Network] settings.

These programs build on 32-bit and 64-bit Linux as well as on Windows using
Visual Studio 2019 on x86 and x64.

This software is licenced under the GPL v2 and is intended for amateur and
educational use only. Use of this software for commercial purposes is strictly
forbidden.
